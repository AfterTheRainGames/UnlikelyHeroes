## Key Contributions as a Gameplay Engineer  

### **Character Selection and Switching**  
  - Developed a character rotation system, allowing players to switch between heroes (bunny, pink, drag, wiz) with unique abilities and appearance.  

### **Combat Mechanics and Shield System**  
  - Implemented dynamic combat mechanics for heroes, including support, defensive, and offensive abilities

### **Enemy AI and Spawning Logic**  
  - Designed enemy AI to randomly select targets and attacks, adjusting difficulty with each wave.  
  - Managed monster spawning to create escalating difficulty, ensuring a challenging progression throughout the game.  

### **User Interface and Feedback**  
  - Created dynamic UI elements to display health, status conditions, damage modifiers, and move descriptions.  
  - Integrated sound effects for combat, shield activation, and monster attacks, providing clear player feedback.  

### **Audio and Visuals**  
  - Added immersive background music and sound effects for hero actions, enemy attacks, and level transitions.  
  - Integrated animations to indicate shield activation, character changes, and health/damage states.

## Challenges Overcome  

### **Character Switching Animation**  
  - **Issue**: Characters were switching abruptly without proper animations.  
    - **Solution**: Used coroutines and animation triggers to seamlessly transition between characters with smooth animations.  


### **Enemy Difficulty Balance**  
  - **Issue**: The game became too easy or too difficult based on enemy spawning rates.  
    - **Solution**: Implemented dynamic scaling of enemy health, attack strength, and spawn rates to ensure challenging but fair progression.

## Reflection  
**Unlikely Heroes** pushed me to balance complex resource management mechanics with smooth character switching and combat. The challenges of AI pathfinding, shield energy management, and dynamic difficulty scaling helped me refine my gameplay engineering skills while working within the constraints of the jam.
