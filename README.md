## Challenges Overcome  

### **Character Switching Animation**  
  - **Issue**: Characters were switching abruptly without proper animations.  
    - **Solution**: Used coroutines and animation triggers to seamlessly transition between characters with smooth animations.  


### **Enemy Difficulty Balance**  
  - **Issue**: The game became too easy or too difficult based on enemy spawning rates.  
    - **Solution**: Implemented dynamic scaling of enemy health, attack strength, and spawn rates to ensure challenging but fair progression.

## Reflection  
**Unlikely Heroes** pushed me to design and implement a turn-based combat system that emphasized strategic decision-making and smooth character switching. The challenge of creating enemy AI behavior, handling combat turn flow, and ensuring balanced character abilities refined my gameplay programming skills. By focusing on creating engaging and dynamic combat encounters within the jamâ€™s constraints, I was able to enhance my ability to craft enjoyable turn-based mechanics that provide both challenge and player agency.
